## On Removing the classic Ember.Object model

 - Application
	 - extends Namespace.extend(RegsitryProxyMixn)
	 - customEvents delegation still exists, bubbling changes are potentially complex to manage if we don't provide a good compat story
 - EmberArray, MutableArray
	 - Ember.A deprecation would deprecate every feature beyond native array
	 - an optional feature to disable the Ember.A-enforced mutation of instances would be good. It makes Ember.A a noop, returning a native array.
 - `@ember/component`
	 - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/389 is merged but unimplemented, we need to do this first
	 - we need to check if any existing framework-provided components still extend `@ember/component`
	 - 
 - computed macros
	 - runspired has a reimplementation of many of the macros in a tracked-based way, could serve as a transitional package for people.
 - reference system supports two-way binding everywhere, would be good to limit it to one specific case
 - deprecate `mut` helper
	 -  but provide some `compat-two-way` alternative that provides a narrower behavior (doesn't call `set`, for example)
 - Controller
	 - exists because QPs, routing story needs to cover that
	 - some like https://github.com/discourse/ember-route-template
 - Helper
	 - class-based helpers extend Ember.Object
	 - we could keep it and just remove the base class (via optional feature or new import)
	 - having no base class at all would be better, existing helper manager API probably covers this
 - ember data
	 - store extends Ember.Object
	 - tracked property compat
	 - don't use array proxy, etc
	 - Model code is tied to classic object model (but plan is to replace it)
