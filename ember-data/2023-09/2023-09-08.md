## Action Items from last meeting:

- we should audit the RFCs advancement pipeline and make sure nothing has been lost
  - still need to do this
- develop communication strategy for the Graph Diffing
  - strategy is a separate post
  - CT to do a short RFC cycle for it

### EmberData Dropdown in API Docs

- need to confirm that switching b/w Ember --> EmberData that the correct list of versions is being used (i.e. Data's versions)
- should consider clarifying what version is selected off the home screen (it's a bit unclear rn)
- also should test switching b/w source having selected an Ember version that doesn't exist for EmberData and ensure it functions as expected
- raise adding a second dropdown with the Learning team (if needed)

### Release 5.3

- [Release 5.3 checklist](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/8743)
- parseCachedControl
  - probably the hardest test to write, involves parsing out Cache-Control header
- JSONAPI Builders
  - mostly tests/docs left
  - https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/8849 is still WIP
  - tests/docs in deleteRecord/updateRecord/createRecord are the biggest things left
    - most important thing is to ensure the right things are done after the calls are made
  - cacheHandler
    - there's currently nothing in the code that switches over the operation
  - REST Serialization was deprioritized b/c we have never really formalized what the REST/Active Record specs are from EmberData's perspective
- any of the open docs/tests tasks are available for people to help with
