## Topics

### ember-cli merge queue

- (brief discussion)
- the merge queue is blocking us because Windows is being flakey at the moment
- CM: it seems like it was since the PR to drop support for Node 16 because npx is a bit more flakey in windows
- EF: if we feel more pain we should turn off merge queue



### Last week ef4 planned to review these, did that happen?
- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/pull/966
  - Merged


- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/973/files
  - the tab is open

- https://github.com/embroider-build/scenario-tester/pull/16
  - Merged
  
- https://github.com/embroider-build/scenario-tester/pull/17
  - Merged

### Can we merge https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/pull/966? <@mansona>

- Merged 

### v2 addon generated test app not using embroider by default in development - it likely should with highest static compatibility enabled and have try configs for other options <@void-mAlex>

- EF: we could add ember-try and do both
- GC: we probably want to test against the mostly likely to break
- you can test the most static and no embroider 
- EF: all of these are in the ember-try config - it's odd that we have the default be a classic app
- right now our embroider apps don't work well during dev on v2 addon
- GC: do we know what the fix is
- EF: inverting control would fix this - i.e. have webpack watch the files
- GC: didn't we fix this in ember-auto-import? 
- EF: yes but that doesn't work in embroider
- GC: if you send me the workaround I can work on an intirum solution
- https://github.com/cardstack/boxel/blob/d54f834fea4e5be5904b60e99e70f3bbb4c8c156/packages/host/ember-cli-build.js#L15
- 

### merge and release https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel/pull/503 <@NullVoxPopuli, but do this without me, I'm not useful here>

- merged!
- CM: we talked about moving this repo into ember-cli, any progress on that?
- GC: Preston asked in the slack and someone said 1 hour ago (at the time of this meeting) that they would do it tomorrow
- released 8.2.0 ðŸŽ‰

### should we close https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1532 now that node started fixing it? <@void-mAlex>

- CM: I don't think we should close until Node 18.18.1 is released 
- EF: seems good to me

### Godfrey has pending PRs and questions

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1632
  - Merged

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1605
  - Looks mostly good
  - EF: if we could avoid adding a new scenario that would be great
  - we are happy to have scenarios being rich apps that do lots of work

### Godfrey has questions about (intended) template tag support

- EF: a native implementation of GJS would look like making sure we have a GJS loader for things like webpack
- including any work that needs to be done in the babel stage
- GC: should addons publish the lower level version with eval? 
- EF: no you should convert it to scopebag for publishing addons
- (general discussions about gjs in different scenarios)
-
