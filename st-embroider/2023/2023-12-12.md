## Topics

### `@glimmer/validator` discussion <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- CM: if we fix it in a compat adapter does that limit the range of ember-versions 
- GC: if we move this to the globals that might lock us into implementation
- EF: we don't want different versions to be supported, it can still die when we have different versions
- we should include the protocol version in the global and die if it doesn't match
- CM: clarify the steps
- GC: if we put the functions on global and then re-export from global that would be better

### ember beta failure <@ef4>

- recent changes in the build mean that there are templates in the source when on embroider optimized
- we can either compile the templates again (previous behaviour) because the wire format is dependent on ember-source version
- or we can use strict mode on the template
- PS: can we still do wire format once glimmer has floating versions?
- EF: yes that's probably true. Having real templates is probably better
- PR not ready yet but here is a gist with the changes that need to happen in ember-source: https://gist.github.com/ef4/ec0a37f23758e843181bd43b8fb19cb3
