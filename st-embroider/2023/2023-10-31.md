## Topics

### Planning asset import spec implementation <@ef4> https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/983

- added to the roadmap
- first step is to setup the todolist

### Plans for stage-3 decorators? <@chancancode>

- EF: Some of ember decorators can work "both ways" - service
- tracked only works with accessor keyword
- we need to design the ecosystem plan for stage-3 decorators
- we could have a compatibility step that adds the accessor keyword where needed
- we need a transition plan so that apps and addons can upgrade independently
- GC I'm going to try it out and report back

### Early services feedback? <@chancancode>

- https://github.com/chancancode/ember-polaris-service/blob/main/test-app/app/services/session.ts#L17
- https://github.com/chancancode/ember-polaris-service/blob/main/test-app/tests/acceptance/session-test.ts#L36

- GC: this is probably a conversation for the spec meeting
- (discussion about the details of the implementation)
- (discussion about service managers and Typescript)
- EF: these learnings would be great to feedback into an RFC

### ESM support in scenario-tester https://github.com/embroider-build/scenario-tester/pull/18 <@mansona>

- merged

### remove volta from CI (again) https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1594 <@mansona>

- happy to merge once CI is green

### v2 addon blueprint rollup requiring extensions for relative imports, but TS doesnâ€™t think so <@chancancode>

- EF: if we can adjust the TS build to be stricter that would be good

### no word back about deprecation-workflow https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow/pulls/lolmaus <@mansona>

- EF: I'll reach out to Matt
