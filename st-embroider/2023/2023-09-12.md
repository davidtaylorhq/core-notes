## Topics

### Should strict mode tests be on by default? Opt out for specific compat scenarios (.skip('strict'))? Have a whole separate scenario altogether? Does it depend on the test? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1593 <@NullVoxPopuli, lolmaus>

- PS: something Preston and chris discussed last week
- EF: still need to test for non strict mode scenarios, so do we want to double up on tests loose and strict
- EF: too vague to have an answer, it's a per-test decicision
- EF: could involve flipping the default instead, one previous proposal was to flip it, but many specs will fail
- EF: some tests will be redundant because they're already strict
- EF: would be good to find examples that are not tested
- EF: matrix is not about strict vs. not strict, it's about versions


### Maintaining and getting familiar with Glint <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: becuase we're the tooling team not just embroider team, we own glint
- PS: should we absorb glint into the org
- EF: spent time in the guts of glint last week, trying to solve issue related to gts extensions
- EF: getting handle on architecture + vision of project, would be simpler if the core only supported polaris featureset +
- EF: core functionality would work with template tag, then the addon would be making it work with older versions
- EF: associating it with gts gjs falls away when you're on the latest
- EF: we can spend some more attention on the issue if we have a plan for how to fix the bug
- EF: currently have a hacky patch that solves it: surgical patch, stringly replacing logic because the proper fix involves changing architecture
- EF: if we think there's a better long term refactor, we should do it because we maintain it now


### embroider optimized with the ember-cli â€“embroider flag https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10370 <@mansona>

- KG: discussion has already happened on PR
- KG: only confusion is about `staticEmberSource` because there's comments (ember inspector issue)
- PS: we could merge and break ember inspector and be on-top of fixing it?
- KG: components seem to become anonymous, inspector loses all names
- EF: we don't want to have to build apps differently because of the inspector
- KG: should we make a task on the project board for fixing the inspector if it's not already there
- (yes)
- EF: the issue is not strictly embroider related, all of template tag will mess with inspector in unpleasent ways too
- EF: new card on Embrodier Roadmap project created: <TODO(@22a): link>
- PS: last week discussed (in spec meeting) using ember data adapter pattern as a solution for this
- EF: The fix for this would be a good one for new contributors to contribute to


### Discuss blocker for template tag support in blueprints https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10332 <@IgnaceMaes>

- IM: ts converted to ts by the blueprint system, but it doesn't support gts
- IM: how should this be moved forward
- IM: makes use of remove-types (external library)
- EF: looking at templateTagIdentifier, this seems unlikely to keep working
- IM: this involves stripping the template tags, removing TS, then re-adding template tag
- EF: another example of where we should make the content-tag parser provide the line/col numbers
- EF: but we don't need to block on this, approved, good to merge when CI is green (new node 20 required checks haven't ran yet, updating branch)
