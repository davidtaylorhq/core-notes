## Topics

### First-class support for developing in-repo addons https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1635 <@chancancode>

- GC wants to capture what was brought up last week, but it seems like I didn‚Äôt capture it very well and/or there are additional things to discuss there

- EF: this issue does capture the problem
- This seems like it's a good idea to have as an optional available in the tooling
- GC: regarding the watching that we discussed last week, v1 addon shim adds the file watcher that we need for now
- EF: after we move to non-broccoli based we will most likely be pull based from the 3rd stage

### https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-load-initializers/pull/303#issuecomment-1763550940 <@chancancode>

- GC thinks we need to implement the feature natively in Embroider and make the addon no-op. Exactly how to ‚Äúmake it no-op‚Äù is a bit unclear, do we override the import resolution to provide a no-op version? Or do we just tell people to remove it from their app.js?
- EF: I don't see a value of making this a built in functionality of embroider
- building more into embroider means that we need to remove it later when we want to
- GC: the main problem is that this relies on the AMD traversal - especially if we are getting rid of the AMD resolver
- EF: I will make sure that this is part of the RFC https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/938 

### Introduce import.meta.glob https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/939 <@chancancode>

- GC is this intended to be macro-ized in babel or transformed into runtime code? I am pretty sure this ‚Äì and potentially some of the existing macros ‚Äì suffer from the same babel caching bug I fixed recently
- GC somewhat related ‚Äì I think I would like a way to participate in the ‚Äúwrite stuff to .rewritten-app stage before babel sees them‚Äù pipeline, for similar reasons
- EF: import.meta.glob will likely be implemented as a plugin in the resolver with its own caching
- this is all about removing the resolver layer (from AMD)
- CM: reminder that we are planning to remove the rewritten-app
- EF: in classic builds it will be a runtime implementation (very like requirejs entries)
- in embroider builds it will be in Webpack or Vite

### Additional module entrypoints in index.html brings in duplicate modules https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1589 <@chancancode>

- GC: is looking for a more stable solution for ‚Äúnamed‚Äù or ‚Äúidentifiable‚Äù chunks/bundle/entrypoints

- GC: (explaining the problem) imagine your app is fully route split
- your first load doesn't have anything - it needs to load the route chunk before it can do anything
- if you have a server you know what the client might need so you can inject pre-fetch (based on the url you need this chunk)
- we also have locale code and admin code
- we want a way to name each of the bundles and have a way to reference them (known location or a JSON)
- EF: `@embroider/webpack` is managing the mapping between html and your entry points
- we could extend it but then webpack would see things as one bundle
- this is essentially just a problem in the final bundler, and isn't really an emberoider specific thing
- GC: the route splitting info isn't available to the 3rd phase
- EF: yea that makes sense
- it is also possible for the bundler to change the chunks and either duplicate or share code
- so you can't rely on this information completely - it's all best guess
- CM: what's the next steps on this?
- GC: just some guidance would be useful on the issue
- EF: I'm convinced that there is a need here


### @embroider/{compat+webpack} builds aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdeterministic‚Äù

- GC: At least on development mode, the build output seems to contain references to local and temporary paths, making the hashed chunks different across machines and sometimes different on two successive builds on the same machine. Do we know if this has caching and build performance implications?

- EF: there should not be anything that is using broccoli temp folders any more
- GC: there is some in the babel configs
- EF: that should be tracked down and fixed
- GC: this also is related to the fact that the full path is included in the hashing 
- A: is that true for production? 
- GC: I can test it and experiment
- A: I think the inversion of control might stabilise things there 
- there are some cases currently that notice changes in html and spin up a new webapck instance that would change your hashes
- 


### Review https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/pull/187 <@nvp, but absent>

- EF: it seems like it's ready
- I wanted to check on the minimums that it requires for other packages
- (checking versions)
- merged üéâ

### Do we have to review performance regression on ember-cli release for Windows on CI https://workflow-waterfall.netlify.app/view/embroider-build/embroider/6540357157 <@mansona>

- A: I suspect that ember-cli 5 added a dependency to get windows defender to scan node_modules
- EF: can we run the slow tests first to save some time? 
- GC: we should create an issue
