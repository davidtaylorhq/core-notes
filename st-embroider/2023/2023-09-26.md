## Topics

### Unblocking content-tag usage <@NullVoxPopuli>
https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel/pull/502 (new plugin)

- EF: looks good. this can go out as a minor
- CM: can we just do a release now? 
- EM: yes
- can someone keep an eye on that to see if it releases

https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/pull/24 (failing tests)

- (this is the backticks issue)
- EF: I assumed this should have been dealt with by SWC's printer
- in transform.rs line 53 we're emitting the template literal
- TplElement is the thing that we use
- it has a key `raw` so it probably expects encoded strings


### Guides telling people to use app.import and other outdated advice - https://guides.emberjs.com/release/addons-and-dependencies/
We should likely rework that to at least advise e-a-i <@void-mAlex>

- EF: a PR to cut all the things that aren't true will be an improvement
- Katie: the cli guides have a lot of stuff that needs updating
- CM: remember the "guides" and the "cli guides" are different things so they both need updated
- (discussion on how to update things)
- EF: it should probably be clear that app.import is a legacy feature with a 

### Can we please merge and release https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel/pull/500 to unblock embroider CI <@mansona>

- already done

### Can we merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1609 even without CI passing? Itâ€™s an unrelated failure and I would like to get unstable released with this fix <@mansona>

- CI is now green
- EF: let's merge this now
- massive performance impact ðŸŽ‰


### Should we merge these other performance improvements https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pulls/raycohen <@mansona>

- [realpathsync](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1608)
- EF: I'm confident that we need this one so we should merge it

- avoid paying decodeFastbootSwitch regex cost unless needed https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1611 
- this is very good but there are some points next to it that need the same treatment


- cache existsSync results in PackageCache.ownerOfFile https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1612
- this is probably good too, it allows you to cache the misses as well as the hits
- we can probably improve it and make it slightly less targeted

### with all these performance related PRs and issues, should we be considering creating a benchmark test suite? <@mansona>

- EF: I wonder if we could gather stats in our full app builds
- CM: I guess we will be told by some companies that are keeping track of these things
- EF: it seems like we shouldn't prioritise this for now

### Update to asset import spec RFC <@katiegengler> https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/973

- EF: I'll do a close read on this now

### pnpm (8.0.0 to 8.6.x) resolution-mode in ember-try: fix, error, readme note? <@lolmaus>
https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/pull/966

- EF: our theory is that if we error on this specific version and lack of config then it's ok
- (long discussion)
- EF: I'm going to merge this unless there is a strong objection

### Remove volta from the CI https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1594 is now passing. Do we want it? <@mansona>

- EF: this isn't the best way to do this
- we can use pnpm version
