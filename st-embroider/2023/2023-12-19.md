## Topics

### content-tag indi

https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/issues/45 

- content-tag _is_ byte ranges
- will add APIs to content-tag so that users don't need to do slicing
  - https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/issues/39#issuecomment-1832443310
- potentially add to content-tag:
  - charStart, charEnd, etc
  - but wouldn't be needed if there is a `transform` callback capability
- Krystan volunteers to PR documentation

### GH actions magically turned on, on forks and unknowingly almost published a new unstable when sync-ing the fork 

- when forking, if users have turned actions on by default for their profile/org, they'll need to manually turn actions off for that fork
- GH problem, GH needs more controls over this

### v2 addons gjs/gts module name exposing system config and bloating bundle size 

- production path includes full system path (sometimes over 300 characters)
  - issue report: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1592
- we want to remove the module name altogether because module name doesn't make sense for `<template>` components.
- add setting to remove?
  - potentially in babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation
- RFC to remove `moduleName`, issue here: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/940
- TODO: investigate -- does ember-intl use `moduleName`? we know the inspector does
  - ember language server's ember-intl integration?
- Idea: `<template>` doesn't emit `moduleName`
  - need to communicate that `moduleName` is optional / sometimes missing
  - move responsibility to the hbs -> js code
    - `<template>` does not go through this path

### Let webpack handle test vs app layering

- https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/issues/503
  - https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/pull/512
- Simon offers to potentially implement, Ed offers to pair with Simon
  - Maybe Chris, too
- Alternative is more work-arounds in codebase
- Simon will ping Chris for status / context as well

### TypeScript team

- rollup TypeScript team into the tooling team

### how are the ember-data types coming along?

- new apis will have types
- old apis may never have official types
- what is blocking from switching the blueprint to built-in types?
  - Krystan to ask Chris (runspired)
