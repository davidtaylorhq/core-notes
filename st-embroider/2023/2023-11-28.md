## Topics

### Rollup file-watching issues <@chancancode>

- GC: just to clarify - do we expect watch mode to work for v2 addons? 
- EF: yes
- GC: in that case we're missing a bunch of [this.addWatchFile()](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#this-addwatchfile) calls
- it also doesn't watch for new files - we're not the only ones that have this problem
- EF: is the difficult case where you want the new file to be an entry point
- (clarification)
- GC: yes
- rollup seems to be missing the feature to have glob as entry point
- (rollup watch mode reloads itself when you touch the config)
- (discussion about adding something that touches the config when it notices a new file)
- EF: we could upstream this to Rollup
- EF: does Rollup allow you to add a new entry point out of band? 
- GC: we can try it
- 

### ember-animated's macroCondition in a getter <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated/pull/633#issuecomment-1830074132

- PS: the branch will never be eliminated in the before case right? 
- EF: yes
- however you need to wrap it in a macro condition

### summarize major release planning <@ef4>

- Motivation: there are some breaking changes that we need to do
- we need to plan the major
- This would be the major release that requires an inversion of control: you have a vite config, webpack config, babel config in the root. And an index.html in the root as the entry point
- this will simplify our internals
- plan - release current main and then have a stable branch that we support with bugfixes
- main will be the new major but will auto release unstables
- breaking changes: 
  - no more support for unserialisable babel configs
  - remove support for lazy imports with importSync - eager by default
  - applying custom broccoli trees to your app code
- we will start working on the upgrade guide while we're working on the new main
- we can decide how "hard" the upgrade path is as we go
- we can add deprecations to the stable branch 
- ember-try will need to work with the new structure, and we need to have a plan to update how an addon will update to this new major
- we can also provide a codemod to move an app to this new structure

### discuss decorator-transforms rollout <@ef4>

- v2 addons can adopt this right away 
- apps have a different story
- the rollout is harder because of the browser compatibility issue
- https://github.com/ef4/decorator-transforms/issues/3
- CM: we should drop support for Safari that doesn't support this in a RFC
- EF: we could optionally use this based on people's targets
