### Discuss making everything from esbuild ‚Äúexternal‚Äù https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1614 <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- CM: I think we need to discuss this with Ed. I don't know if we should do this
- AM: can we ask the alternative question - what would be the bad if we did this
- CM: there are a few changes that Ed made to the PR that we would want to check if it's ok to merge first (i.e. the early out for module resolve)
- TODO waiting for ed to take a look


### can we add lolmaus to the Triage Team https://github.com/orgs/embroider-build/teams/triage-team and add embroider and scenario-tester to it <@mansona>

- CM: I think only Ed or Katie can do this
- should more people be able to do this? 


- Update: Katie added Andrey for us üéâ

### ember-cli-babel update <@NullVoxPopuli>

  - https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel/pull/503

- PS: this is a follow up to adding static-class-block to the default scenario when you don't have an explicit babel config file - the previous fix was for when you had an explicit babel config
- we need to consider having more people with access to be able to re-run the failing job

- UPDATE: katie re-ran this üéâ
- PS: should we ask them to move this to ember-cli org
- KG: we could ask them

### archive ember-cli-jshint

  - https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-jshint

- PS: I opened an issue to archive

- update: we archived it üéâ


### Godfrey‚Äôs PR/questions (prioritized)
- Crashes: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1619 
  - How to test these things?
  - Apparently there is at least one other crash involving .gjs which I will work on tracking down.
- Attributes in HTML files: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1605
- CI for swc: https://github.com/embroider-build/swc/pull/1 (But the test suite is huge, beware)

- (discussion)
- GC: is GJS first class in embroide 
- (uncertain discussion)
- CM: it seems like we're outputting something similar to what content-tag is outputting
- GC: sounds like we want  gjs to be first class in embroider

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1605 
- TODO Ed to review
