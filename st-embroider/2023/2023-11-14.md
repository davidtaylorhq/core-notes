## Topics

### https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/issues/628<@NullVoxPopuli, @Simon> 
  - now with easy reproduction link
  - NVP doesn't have an idea for how to resolve
  - NVP also tried moduleResolution: node16 with module node16, no dice

- because we're not publishing GTS files to npm your declarations definitely can't have .gts in our declarations
- also not sure what to do here
- we just need to put this on someone's todo list or as an item that we can work on together at office hours
- it looks like glint has implemented the required .gts support for typechecking but not for declarations
- the change need to happen in glint
