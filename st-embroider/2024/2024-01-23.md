## Topics


### Declaration generation issue /// <@NullVoxPopuli>

- reference https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/issues/248 
- (discussion about typescript doing the wrong thing)
- EF: we could demo that they're doing the wrong thing here
- PS: they suggested that we change to type module everywhere
- (discussion about things that prevent us from using type module)

### Release plan fixes <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/release-plan/pull/47
- CM: we need to add tests for everything now
- it doesn't need to be comprehensive
- take a look at the corresponding change to our fork of lerna changelog

### OOM errors after v2 migration on classic+eai build <@simonihmig>

- (discussion of the problem)
- EF: it's possible that we pay the cost for every consumption of a v2 addon
- we should investigate the de-duplication is right
- for ember-auto-import we could spawn webpack as a separate process and do inter-process communication
- 

### vite node resolver issue with ts files <@mansona>

- potential solution for ambiguous helper.ts resolution
- in resolvecomponent we use the default resolve (i.e. pass back to vite or webpack)
- we would need to thread it through
- we would make beforeResolve and fallbackResolve private and all plugins would have to go through resolve
