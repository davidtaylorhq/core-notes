## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### discuss the use of wyvox/action-setup-pnpm <@mansona>

- Iâ€™ve had some pushback from people generating a new v2 addon and it being part of their workflows
- Is this pushback worth the value of having it?

- if we are going to use the action we can move it ember-cli org to help with trustability
- (discussion on if we even need it)
- CM: so if we might not need it we're open to me creating a PR to remove it
- ALL: aggreed  

### Ask TypeScript team to review Polaris project board <@kategengler> 

- (discussion about triage of issues)
- PS: https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/issues/628
  - typescript in v2 addons with gts is essentially broken right now because of this
- https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/issues/599
- 

### is this something we need to fix? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1745 <@simonihmig>

- EF: it's probably not working correctly in ember-auto-import
- added a link to the line that probably needs to be fixed

### introduce and give feedback on https://github.com/simonihmig/ember-addon-config <@simonihmig>

- how to configure an addon without using macros
- EF: feedback - make it an esmodule
- it's good that this doesn't allow config of addon's addon dependencies for simplicity
- if this works well we could just make it a feature and not an addon
- we do need to have a solution for addons to add addon config if we're going to auto 

### update of The Plan - i.e. current main of embroider <@mansona>

- CM: we merged a PR today that stops supporting ember-source 3.28, 4.4 and release
- we now only support ember-canary which is going to be 5.7
- we intend to add support back in later but we're doing it this way to allow us to work fast for now
- EF: we will also be doing this for vite-only support for the tests very soon
- we should also look into turning our hbs template resolver into a codemod that moves you to gjs
  - this may need to be manditory
  - we also might need to enforce v2 addons to use strict mode for templates
