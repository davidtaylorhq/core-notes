## Topics

### discussion of the implementation of RFC #726 (DOM Element Descriptors) in qunit-dom

- (overview of the high level of the rfc)
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/726
- https://github.com/mainmatter/qunit-dom/pull/2087
- (bigger discussion)
- Main concern with the pluggable strategy is the types
- CM: if we have a way forward with this we can try it out

### is this ok to fix CI on ember-auto-import? https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/pull/622 <@mansona>

- discussed in the pre-meeting
- almost the right implementation
- try bumping the version that consumed minimatch (i think ember-cli-babel)

### babel ordering issues with import meta glob plugin work? https://github.com/beerinho/ember-glob-import-demo <@mansona on behalf of @beerinho>

- dicussed in the pre-meeting
- async babel plugins don't work


### When to RFC v2 addon authoring? <@ef4>

- it would be nice to not have a monorepo
- the challenge is that to boot an ember app you need a package
- bottled-ember is a workaround by building a package for you on the fly
- it would be better to boot the app properly using the v2 app mode
- CM: it should be fine if we only allow this new mode work with v2 addon deps
- or if you have v1 addons it's reasonable that we can discover this
- A: what about peer-dependencies (optional)
- EF: maybe we could have an import path for optional compat modules
- if we add limitations to this it could make it easier
- if we only allow template tag that would really help
- (large discussion about new structure)
- CM: if we restructure the monorepo version to have addon at top level and test apps in subfolder that would be easier to "opt into" later
- EF: that is more one-to-one for upgrading
- CM: we should probably deprecate yarn@1 if so (I don't think it works)
- EF: we should also consider pushing all v2 addons to use template tag
- we can drop a lot of work in Embroider if we do this
- i.e. v2.1 addons
- this could give a good performance win
- SI: it's worth mentioning that we need to solve the generator issue with v2 before we can make it default
