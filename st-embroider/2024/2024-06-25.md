## Topics

### Windows hard-link errors in node-fixturify-project https://github.com/stefanpenner/node-fixturify-project/pull/99 <@mansona on behalf of @patricklx>

- (long discussion about the specifics)
- CM: I misunderstood, this actually has exactly the behaviour I wanted
- merge it!! 
- EF: merged
- and released 

### Template only names for inspector https://github.com/emberjs/babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation/pull/58 <@patricklx>

- EF: do we want this
- PS: is this something to opt-into for certain builds
- A: dev builds maybe it should be there
- EF: not unreasonable as a default
- (discussion about the merits of the change)
- EF: added a comment to the PR to cover what we discussed

### Any known reason why service initialisation would be off with ember-route-template? I’m getting undefined services where I didn’t have them before <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- EF: probalby not ember-route-template
- everything that is being described is expected to work
- it's probably worth debugging the actual issue
