## Topics


### ember-template-imports @ 4 doesn't work with enableTypeScriptTransform <@NullVoxPopuli>

- See [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/518154533143183377/1203375523527393331), and [reported issue](https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/issues/228)
- do we need to convert template-imports and ember-cli-babel / ember-cli-htmlbars to monorepos so we can actually test the integration between all these? (NVP thinks yes, it seems testing within the same packaging isn't sufficient, and we need an extracted workspace to solve dep cycles)

- EF: I don't want to move them to the same monorepo
- I also don't want to be maintaining ember-cli-htmlbars long term
- we should be thinking of this as a way to get template imports into a classic app
- just need to debug the repro repo to see what the actual issue is - won't do that live in this meeting

### Peer confusion https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1789 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the depth of the problem)
- EF: we could add the peer check to are-my-node-modules-messed-up
- we could also convert it to a lib that embroider uses
- PS: I'll create an issue for this functionality

### Should there be a deprecation of non-co-located components? Some issues need to be resolved for vite apps, is this just a bug? <@mansona>

- CM: is this something that we should deprecate because of 
- EF: it should both get deprecated and fixed
- virtual pair component is the thing that should be supporting this case
- it could be doing something subtly differnt/wrong in vite
- CM: where does this get deprecated?
- EF: the code for this is in ember (somewhere)
- this is very important to deprecate because it can't work in template tag in a classic app
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/995

### Control ember prebuild from vite - review PR https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1744 <@mansona>

- probably shouldn't be caching - rely on the broccoli build and if that's broken we should fix it
- reviewed together: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1744#pullrequestreview-1865805634

### decorator-transforms compatibility approach https://github.com/ef4/decorator-transforms/issues/3 <@davidtaylorhq>

- it would be nice to detect preset-env and check targets if we can use static blocks
- we can also just expose a config that would be controlled from the outside
