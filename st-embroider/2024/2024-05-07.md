## Topics

### Fixturify-project PRs https://github.com/stefanpenner/node-fixturify-project/pulls/mansona <@mansona>

- EF: this is most likely a bug in TSup
- (discussion of the interop question)
- EF: try it with createRequire from node

### Discussion of serverMiddleware hook a) generically and b) specifically for fastboot <@mansona>

- (discussed the fastboot case in office-hours)
- we will need to make fastboot work differently than using an express server
- CM: the main dependencies that are using it don't seem to need this: https://emberobserver.com/code-search?codeQuery=serverMiddleware&sort=updated&sortAscending=false
- (discussion about the list)
- general concensus: it's ok to not support this going forward
- CM: I assume we don't need to do an RFC to continue
- EF: we will have to do a garbage collection pass much later to disable each of these things

### Narrowed down broccoli trees for optimized file watching https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1901 <@simonihmig>

- (discussion about the whole process)
- EF: looks good (approved)
