## Topics

### ember-engines release/maintain access && pr https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines/pull/855 <@void_mAlex>

- A: I'm doing some maintenance on the repo now
- my blocker is cleared

### fix on stable or work around? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1835 <@simonihmig>

- SI: should we prioritise the fix on stable for this or should we backport?
- we have a workaround so we're not blocked right now
- (discuss the issue)
- EF: yes this is worth fixing
- CM: reminder - the RFC for non-colocated component deprecation will be pushing (some) people towards this pattern so we really need to fix this

### with correct tsconfig settings, eti4 + gjs is broke after enabling ts https://github.com/retailnext/ember-bem-helpers/pull/187 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: this seems like the same issue where typescript is stripping things before we get a chance to see it
- CM: added a item to the agenda to discuss the design of what needs to change to fix this

### Declaring non-support for @taskFor for ember-concurrency@v3,4+ https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters/pull/465 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the issue)
- with a recent RFC discussion we might be able to have ember-concurrency use test waiters instead of the runloop
- PS: I'll keep going with this

### V2 Addon Generator by @bertdeblock https://github.com/bertdeblock/gember <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion)
- CM: this is great for authoring content
- it doesn't solve our compisition question though
- when we were looking at layergen we didn't want to get people to change things once and change again when we come out with the better example
- EF: this is better for small components rather than full apps, we don't need to compose quite as easily

### Deprecate hbs support for glint? 

- we should consider it
- no official plans
- EF: reasoning about glint is much easier in template tag
- A: there are some issues around removing fuctionality because monorepos and VSCode integration is all or nothing
- EF: glint implementation for VSCode was always a bit rough


### any ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš© on https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/pull/75 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: yes you need to parse the injected code
- CM: consider the case where the injected code having a syntax error, then you need to error right here and now
- (discussion of API design)
- EF: we could invent an API to make it a templated string where you have some ast and some string literals so it doesn't need to reparse every time
- it might not be necessary if this parse from SWC is very fast
- PW: let's parse on the rust side and maybe do some benchmarking
- EF: there is a file that's using snippets of AST if you want to investigate that side
- this also depends on some of the other PRs that are working on scoping questions with the swc upgrade


### any objections to merging â€‹â€‹https://github.com/embroider-build/github-changelog/pull/17 <@mansona>

- no, go ahead

### discuss the typescript scope problem i.e. typescript removing imports that are only being used in templates <@mansona>

- Potential solution: lock down design for ember-cli-babel to be able to configure verbatim typescript when we use babel typescript transform
- (pre discussion about potential plans)
- EF: it would be better to use the explicit babel config (maybe)
- (discussion about how to solve this)
