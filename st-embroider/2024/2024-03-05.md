## Topics

### How do we feel about simple v2 upgrades? https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inflector/pull/499 The context: ember-mirage depends on it and we will be pushing people that way soon. <@mansona> 

- EF: it should be a case-by-case basis
- e.g. `@ember/string` isn't "simple" in this case
- we should consider moving things to pure libraries where possible
- unless you're importing things from ember-source
- (discussion about `@ember/string`)
- 

### release-plan boilerplate? https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters/pull/468 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- approved

### A better DX for v2 addon CSS authoring and paths to assets <@mansona>

- converting an addon to v2 with a static CSS import https://github.com/empress/guidemaker-default-template/pull/49
- we need to include a config to load assets: https://github.com/empress/guidemaker-default-template/pull/49/files#diff-79bd52d36498e1639f62dec1be8cdcc1782f4f489cbf0b5d9bbf73c8da9137ff
- SI: we could add some plugin to webpack that could issolate this to just css imports
- EF: if we could limit it to CSS then i'd be ok with that
- if we can limit this to css then we don't need to have a list of extensions
- url() in css should get asset handling


### the resolver and virtual modules https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1831 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the problem)
- this might be fixed when we remove the rewritten app... maybe
- this could be an ordering problem
- this could be an issue with the skipSelf bug in vite https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13852
- CM: if your virtual content is importing virtual content you can output virtual imports directly (i.e. not needing to go through resolveId again)

### content-tag hygiene https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/issues/71 <@chancancode>

- should we be using swc's hygine or doing our own
- they have a lot of mangling that we don't need
- it can still break us
- EF: ultimately the code that decides what goes in the scope bag should be possible to plugin the full compile here
- i.e. right now we have eval here but we could change that
