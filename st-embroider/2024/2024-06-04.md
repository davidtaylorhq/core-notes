## Topics

### Initializers in the constructor? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1780 <@mansona>

- EF: no we can't do this
- (discussion about the problem)
- we need to drop the `ember-load-initializers` dependency
- we need a embroider style of doing things 
  - maybe `import { initializers, instanceInitializers } from '@embroider/core/initializers`
- but really there shouldn't be specific implementation
- we really need our `import allModules from '@embroider/core/modules`
  - then we just look at this value and find initializers
- next steps
  - app boot
  - return modules from "entrypoint"
  - loop through modules for initializers
- Note: it must be powered by app files
- 

### import meta glob status <@nullvoxpopuli>

- Demo repos: https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-import-meta-glob-demos
- classic demo and vite demo has 
- in classic if someone specifies extensions it's removed
- EF: it would be nice if we can enforce people to include extensions
- A: are the imports the same in the vite app? do they use extensionless
- PS: yes
- (walkthrough of the code)
- CM: what is the behaviour difference between classic and vite then
- EF: we should try to match the vite behaviour as much as we can
- what happens with `*.png`?
- what happens with `*.svg`?
- EF: we could make this only support strict es modules feature flag
- one of the motivations of this is with strict es modules you can't do require.entries any more and this is an alternative way to support getting modules
