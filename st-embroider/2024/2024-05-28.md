## Topics

### https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/pull/626  eai windows woes <@void-mAlex>

- discovered an issue with sharedInternals for windows
- we need to fix it on stable

### discussion of an api for macros isTesting() to deal with a public API for production && force build tests <@mansona> 

- we need to be able to run production build with tests
- (discussion)
- CM: is this something that should go into a babel config
- EF: yea maybe
- there could be some other changes that would need to happen
- we might want to have an embroider config file
- if vite and webpack both care about a single setting then it would be great that they exist in a different file
- (looking into the code)
- it looks like we can probaly remove the macros global `mode` now that each macro can express if it relies on runtime info
- CM: how do we move forward?
- EF: maybe the config in meta is the simpler version
- i would like it to be a micro library `@embroider/config-meta` is fine


### https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/issues/288  testing components from engines faces the same issues Looks like re-exporting from a dummy app works within classic and embroider optimized world <@void-mAlex>

- (back and forth discussion about the details of the problem)
- CM: maybe we just don't support embroider optimized
- A: we can support it if we have one weird trick of rexporting private things in an engine
- (mumbles and grumbles)
- consensus: probably fine 

<5 mins> get some early feedback on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1936 if we have time at the end (since we didnâ€™t get to it in office hours) <@mansona>

- (discussion of the issue)
- tip: run it on main with debug and double check the output
- possible issue with candidates
