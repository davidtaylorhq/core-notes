## Topics

### discuss the typescript scope problem i.e. typescript removing imports that are only being used in templates. Potential solution: lock down design for ember-cli-babel to be able to configure verbatim typescript when we use babel typescript transform <@mansona>

- EF: there are a few bugs here that we are looking at
  - scope problem: the babel plugin for typescript is extremely early in the process so it's dropping things that haven't been used
    - we could solve this if we make our code much earlier (it might cost us on performance)
  - "linearGradient" issue - i.e. we need a list of allowed elements in glimmer
    - there is a PR from patrick that could be a good solution that just adds everything in JS scope to the template
    - the pr needs some work (and tests)
  - swc has a bug in "this" 
    - requires the update PR
    - there might be something wrong with this PR even though it's passing
    - EF: I'll write a test to see if what I suspect is wrong is actually wrong

### explicit babel config for classic apps <@ef4>

- classic apps don't have any (nice) way to add an AST transform
- in embroider we have code to discover your addon babel plugins
- in classic we will need to do that by exposing a function from ember-cli-babel that does the same thing
- non serialisable plugins are going to be a pain in this implementation
- CM: don't we have a todo item for a deprecation for non-serialisable babel configs? 
- EF: yes, and that would make this work much easier
- if anyone wants to work on this that would be great

### how strict do we want to be on private ember modules? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/packages/shared-internals/src/ember-standard-modules.ts
- EF: that list is going to be shifting (based on ember version)
- I'm fine with adding things here that people are usings
- in time we're going to have to refactor this to be more correct
