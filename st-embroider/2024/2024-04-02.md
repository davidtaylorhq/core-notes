- https://github.com/emberjs/babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation/pull/33
- EF: I'm ok with going ahead with this implementation

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1845 @patricklx

- great work ðŸŽ‰
- needs a bit of work on the binary expression implementation (commented)
- in fact we should take out that implementation, the spec for embroider says that we only support template strings and there is nothing that you can do with binary expressions that you can't do with template strings


### Feedback on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1826#issuecomment-2031981224 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- overall a great thing to be working on, it would be brilliant to land
- can't move forward without passign tests
- it would be great to dicuss some of the secondary changes needed in office hours if Patrick could join soon
