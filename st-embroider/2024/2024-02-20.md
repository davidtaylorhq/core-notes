## Topics

### Can I be made an admin of https://github.com/embroider-build/github-changelog so I can set things up properly for release <@mansona>

- EF: done

### any objection to moving create-release-plan-setup to the embroider-build repo? Or is it time to create a release-plan org? https://github.com/mansona/create-release-plan-setup/issues/83 <@mansona>

- EF: no objection


### Allow branch elimination for getConfig macro: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1804 <@simonihmig>

- in dev the getconfig is considered dynamic
- for fastboot cases - use top-level await and optionally import things if not in fastboot
- for the linked case - we probably don't want to roll out a breaking change
- we could provide a different API or an opt-in to prevent config from being dynamic
- for fastboot we could add something to macros 
- or we could change getConfig smarter so it only says that it has a runtime implementation when it's fastboot

### https://github.com/embroider-build/release-plan/issues/59 <@nullvoxpopuli>

- (long discussion)
- EF: I'm going to respond to the issue sketching a good plugin API
