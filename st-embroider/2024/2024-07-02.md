## Topics

### Is the type solution in https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2006 ok? Asking in terms of app blueprint discussions. <@mansona on behalf of @BlueCutOfficial>

- EF: we can decare the module as an `export default Record<string, unknown>`
- CM: but it makes sense to have this in people's app?
- EF: yes
- I wouldn't define the window.d to a local
- and I would do a tsignore right in the app.ts
- 

### ember-string as v2 https://github.com/emberjs/ember-string/pull/425 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: we should consider if this is going to make the footguns in the 4.x version worse or better
- CM: won't it have it's own copy because of ember-auto-import and Webpack?
- EF: but it matters about the AMD namespace
- we don't know who wins
- PS: I could add back in some test apps to check to see what copy is used by the apps

### make tooling team happen https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/1116 <@mansona>

- (discussion)
- consensus: lets get this merged
- consensus: lets add the typescript team to this PR


### issue with auditing vite deps <@mansona>

- move failing tests to runtime tests
- use the ember-auto-import technique of checking the value of an export

### app tree merging idea <@ef4>

- EF: idea that came out of the vite deps investigation
- we discussed the idea before about opening the gap between codemod and rewrite
- what if we force people to do the app-tree exports in their own app
- this removes embroider's need to fix the app merging issues
- we could even error on boot
- CM: this simplifies the discoverability
- A: what about dummy apps
- CM: we can make this part of the rewritten app code (we still need it for dummy apps)
- A: we have problems with engines
- EF: yes that's an annoying issue
- we could make it part of the v1 addon rewrite for engine 
- CM: should we have an opt-out for people that are not relying on global resolver? i.e. gjs
- EF: we could do patterns to exclude it 
- or semantic booleans for components and service
- the error message can give you the sync command or the config
- CM: similar to MD's recent change to the app boot error message
- where should this happen?
- EF: at the end of the pre-build just before the resolver config is written out
- we should think of this command as a sync command 
  - we should be outputting a comment that says this is autogenerated and on future runs of the command it updates
  - maybe the comment should have the version that is 

### second github project - embroider initiative handover <@mansona> 

- CM: I'm going to create a project in the embroider-build org that replicates https://github.com/orgs/mainmatter/projects/8/views/1
- EF: sounds good
- CM: I'll do this soon


### plan for the open this bug in content-tag <@ef4>

- skipped and added to next week's agenda


### is there a next step for https://github.com/ef4/prember/pull/82 <@mansona>

- quick pairing session on it
- merged!
