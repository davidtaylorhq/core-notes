## Topics

### should we backport removing wyvox/action-setup-pnpm from ember-cli blueprints? https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10436 <@mansona>

- CM: backporting it might be useful for ember-cli-update into a LTS
- but then technically it's not LTS because it could be introducing a bug
- EF: probably not worth it, especially since most blueprints are for new apps


### rsvp + auto-import? What's expected behavior? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-simple-auth/issues/2731
- Declare as peer? Or automatic (like @ember/?) 

- (quick discussion)
- conclusion: that's a bug in ember-auto-import
- commented on the issue with the place that needs fixed/checked


### Can this be reviewed? https://github.com/stefanpenner/node-fixturify-project/pull/87 (I know it is not quite in the remit of this team) <@mansona>

- (discussion)
- merged

### Reduce diff of v2 blueprint between TS and non-TS projects. https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/issues/258 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion)
- not 100% slam dunk to do this
- CM: I'm concderned about complexity leaking in for people who don't want TS
- PS: alternatively we can add ability to ember-cli-update to add flags
- CM: you can just add the flags to the `config/ember-cli-update.json`
- EF: but that means that you would be adding the flags to the "before" state too
- CM: it would be something that we add to the api to have differing flags for the "after"
- 


### Prep for converting @embroider/addon-dev to ESM <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1799

- EF: seems good
- commented

- And https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1766

- (discussion)
- EF: we don't want to have individual builds for each package
- CM: It sounds like we need https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1591
- we should pair on this and get it over the line
- EF: yes doing that work would separate the concerns in this PR

- Leading to this, finally: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1798 (better glint integration)

- (discussion)


### The angle brackets codemod only works with `@ember/component`, not `@glimmer/component` <@lolmaus>

- (discussion)
- EF: it looks like the telemetry helpers is doing the wrong thing
- just update the tests
-
