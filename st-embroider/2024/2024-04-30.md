## Topics

### revert ember-cli-babel major bump on minor @embroider/util version https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1891  <@mansona> 

- merged 

### Confirmation that this is ok to merge: Splitting reusable module visitor out of Audit https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1882 <@mansona>

- merged and follow up PR created

### Fixing embroider-only library dev watch mode <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1892

- PS: forgot that broccoli-side-watch was introduced
- EF: this will all not be much of a problem once we invert control
- I'm not sure why this isn't just working on the current Embroider
- broccoli-side-watch is really the way forward until we land inversion of control
- we might need to remove v2 addons from optimised deps for vite
- A: doesn't vite already not optimise `workspace:` packages?
- EF: yes that's probably correct


### ember-cli-status update and help with next steps plz <@mansona>

- CM: ember-cli-fastboot CI is much better now
- what do we want to do about https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/blob/master/packages/ember-cli-fastboot/vendor/experimental-render-mode-rehydrate.js
- EF: we can just have it silently fail if Ember isn't working on global
- alternatively we should move this to an importable library function that people have to add to their app.js
- CM: can I do that in a minor? 
- EF: for something with experimental in the name: yes
- CM: I'll keep experimental in the name
- EF: it might not be a big deal to do a major
- CM: I might do the simple thing first to unblock everything
- 

### Remove extraneous test-app (for ember-concurrency@v3) https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters/pull/472

- merged

### Add test to prove ember-fetch@8 works with the current test-waiter system/integration https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters/pull/471

- (discussion about ember-fetch in general)
- 

### Feasibility of lazy mounting engines (non routable) under embroider/vite https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines/pull/892 <@void-mAlex>

- (long discussion about the future of ember engines and what will be possible in Embroider)
- EF: we shouldn't be building things that preditct what will be possible in Embroider
- most of what engines is doing will go away eventually
- A: if people want to spend the time on it shouldn't we let them
- EF: people should spend their time on makign their engine v2 and strict with GJS
- you can do the whole thing without thinking about engines
- this discussion brings up the need to formalise the app boot work we've discussed before
- 

### Deprecate import Ember from 'ember' https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20686

- (discussion about the interoperability of window.onError and ember.onError)
- EF: the high level question is what are the right patterns people should be replacing Ember.onError with?
- PS: more so should our ember tests be using things interally that we have deprecated
- (discussion about assert.rejects using Ember.onError internally)
-
