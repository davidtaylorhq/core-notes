## Topics

### macros config design for v2 apps <@ef4>

- where do we want to put config for macros in v2 addons
- classically we relied on it running code in the broccoli pipeline
- we could put this in the explicit babel config 
- this isn't the best design right now for authoring
- the original RFC said that we could add build hooks to v2 addons
- we could do that, but as we progressed we didn't think it was a great idea so we didn't implement it
- CM: counter point - the ember-data issue isn't a good use case for the problem
- we should probably just fix the issue in ember-data
- SI: https://github.com/simonihmig/ember-addon-config
- this would make it easier to communicate what someone does to set some config for my addon
- (discussion about the babel authoring format)
- SI: will this only work with embroider apps? 
- EF: good question
- if we had a standalone file we could have different implementations that read it
- we have had a conversation about adding babel configs to classic apps (for a very long time)
- CM: couldn't we just use the same implementation that we were going to use in embroider
- (discussion about how much of stage 1 to reimplement for babel config discovery)
- SI: this is all nice, but a separate file is easier
- next has a next.json
- does this need to be an RFC?
- CM: it could be part of the new app blueprint RFC
- EF: it's probably better to have separable RFCs since it's going to be so big
- it will probably need an RFC because it changes the coordination story
