## Topics

### New Discourse Theme: PS 5 mins

PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/discourse-emberjs-theme/pull/5
Lots of disco: https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-forum-theme-tada/14537/32

- Discussed by RM in Discord before the meeting and it is already merged ðŸŽ‰

### Release week CM: 10mins

- who is doing it?
  - JG: I can do it

- guides issue (JG and CM pairing)
  - Ember Data is broken from lockstep
  - it causes an issue if we do 2 releases out of step because our tooling generates links from guides to api docs
  - it assumes that ember-source and ember-data have the same version
  - CM and JG were pairing on a fix for our tooling
  - AG: how do we know what versions of ember-source and ember-data match? 
  - CM: our assumption is that it would be like "freezing in amber" or a snapshot in time. Whatever verison of ember-data is released when we do a release will be the version that we link to
  - that way we can update it later if it's not correct
  - JG: I'll push the WIP that we were pairing on for the tooling - edit: https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1984
  - CM: I'll look at finishing it this week

### ember-api-docs node upgrade CM: 2mins

- CM: api docs is out of date
- i fixed it https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/900
- we can now run it on Node 16, 18, and 20
- I did this to try and use embroider with it
- JG: did it help?
- CM: I'm not sure ðŸ˜‚ I might just embroiderise the redesign because that has been updated a lot more
- 

### ember-api-docs ember-cli for real CM: 10 mins

- forever https://ember-cli.com/api/ was never updated
- Katie updated it
- CM: I was nerd sniped and tried to add the data into our CLI app https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/897
- there is a lot of work to keep going with this but I don't have the capacity to finish this work
- AG: is this in our domain? 
- JG: the content isn't in our domain, the app is
- CM: is the code that extracts the conent from the source our domain?
- AG: we are really under staffed
- CM: I would like to try to do a Call to Action to get help championing this work
- AG: I'm worried this would put extra effort on the redesign work because it would mean more components being designed
- CM: no - if that ever happened then we would ignore that in the cli docs rather than add to our plate 
- CM: i'll toot about it
