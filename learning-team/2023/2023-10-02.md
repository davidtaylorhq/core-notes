## Topics

### API docs search (JG) 

- JG: I'm still planning to do this
- JW: if you don't get to it in the next few days can we write an issue
- CM: lets do that now
- https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs-data/issues/14#issuecomment-1743235069
- this is the "smallest possible change" that could fix the situation right now


### AI Experiment with the help bot (JW, 10mins)

- JW: NullVoxPopuli is trying out an AI help bot
- startup is called [glime](https://glimelab.ai/)
- they are training it on api docs and it also reads stack overflow
- it's in a private channel while we evaluate it
- it's not right all the time, but it gives you clues and cites its sources
- NullVoxPopuli is testing with a few others people and then we'll open it to a wider group for feedback
- JW: how do we appropriatly message this
- CM: are we able to get a list of questions asked so we could see what things are lacking in our own docs?
- JW: I'll ask the group
- this could also point to places that are potenitally lacking in Ember or in the guides
- CM: this implies that we would need to audit the answers so we would know if they are good or bad answers
- JW: we might be due another wave of "stack overflow fixing" 
- 

### API Docs Data update (CM, 5mins)

- CM: we fixed all the things ðŸŽ‰
- we should close all of the data related issues with comments that look like this: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/issues/867#issuecomment-1743276424
- our current system is better than it was on the previous one ðŸ˜±ðŸŽ‰
- we should probably figure out how to merge https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/92
- CM: I tried to rebase but I didn't understand the diff
- JW: there were some changes to main/master that prevented whole sections of ember-data from getting skipped
- CM: could someone verify that didn't happen in 5.3 because we didn't have those changes in the `github` branch

### Hacktoberfest (AG, 10mins)

- Essentially an Epic: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/issues/113
- JW: we should make sure that we're doing the right thing for things to be accepted
- we should go over any PRs in ember-learn to see if they count
- Also an epic: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-data-request-service-cheat-sheet/issues/1
- JW: liberally merge in this repo and we can improve them as we go
- it's a work in progress
- CM: it looks like the request-service-cheat-sheet isn't showing up in the help-wanted.emberjs.com
- I created an issue: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-help-wanted-server/issues/54

### Start embroidering ember-api-docs (CM, 5mins)

- CM: I'm going to start an epic to update api-docs
- I'll try to focus on creating issues and not do the work myself
-
