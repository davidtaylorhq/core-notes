### Syntax highlighting (IM)

Guidemaker template changes, switching the syntax highlighter from prism to shiki, so that it will also support `.gjs` and `.gts`. Chris (CM) might want to include an Ember update into the breaking change.

This new syntax highlighter might also be used in the API docs, but has a memory leak (not strictly the highlighter but since its been introduced it is showing up). JG is trying to update the version of Ember in the API docs to fix this. [PR for the highlighting](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/902) and [PR for upgrading to Ember](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/904). JG will make more PRs to upgrade, and will ping us in the learning channel to review and merge. JG is working down [this list](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/blob/master/config/deprecation-workflow.js), feel free to pick one, but please communicate about it, so that people are not doing duplicate work.

### Fixing release process guides (JG)

CM and JG worked on fixing linking from the Guides to the API docs for when EmberData is not in lockstep. JG is working on a [PR](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/2002) that we can use with passing a specific EmberData version to fix the links for that release. When this is merged and released it means everybody could do releases for the Learning team again.

### EmberTimes

AG will write a EmberTimes this week, there is not a lot of news in the news-and-announcement channel, but that's okay :)
