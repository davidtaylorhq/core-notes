## Topics

### Feature Flag / Toggle <@jaredgalanis>

- https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template/pull/191

- JG: discussion about feature flags
- IM: basic implementaion is imporant
- then we can start using it for other things like template tags
- JS vs TS is another discussion
- should we have switches per code block or globally
- CM: I think we talked about needing surrounding blurbs
- that way we shouldn't be 
- IM: we need to unblock polaris docs, we can get people to start contributing
- CM: assuming the tech part is done, how do we deal with multiple toggles at the same time? polaris and typescript
- do we need 4 versions of the docs?
- CM: we need to be clear about the point of the feature flag
- it is intended to be a mechanism to preview the new guides
- (discussion about the feature flag)
- (description of CM's idea of how the toggle will exactly work)
- Action Item: CM to write down the exact plan so get everyone in the core teams can agree on the plan
- (discussion about sub-flags)

### Deprecations PR from Katie/Nullvox <@jaredgalanis>

- https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/pull/1383
- CM: I don't think this is highest priority, I don't think we should complicate the data structure of the deprecations
- (general discussion)
- (general agreement that we don't need to merge the PR to get https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/pull/1381 merged)
- JG: devil's advocate - we have been slow on making changes to the website so delaying merging the deprecation PR because of a new layout
- CM: I'm not saying to not merge the deprecation PR, I think it's fine
- (discussion about performance of the app)
- AG will respond to the PR
