## Topics

### Using shiki in the guides - and other places (IM, 15 mins)

- CM: the main blocker right now is that I want to get the ember upgrade into the same major update https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template/pull/178
- this has been blocked for months but now we're days away from merging it
- once that's added we can just merge the release PR and it will automatically release https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template/pull/176
- IM: what is next, maybe the blog?
- CM: this needs to be updated here: https://github.com/ember-learn/empress-blog-ember-template replacing ember-showdown-prism
- IM: this work is blocked on the new release of empress-blog because we need the latest ember-cli-showdown
- https://github.com/empress/empress-blog/pull/185 
- CM: I want to try to update the repo to 5.4 before I release this major too
- if I don't release it in the next month I'll release the major as is and we can worry about the update later
- we're also looking into doing this for api-docs too https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/902


### Tutorial updates - issues and plan for the way forward (CM, 10 mins)

- CM: most urgent change is to fix what we have https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/2000
- then we need to figure out how to integrate the tutorial updates better into our release process
